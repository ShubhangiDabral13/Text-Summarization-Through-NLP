# Text-Summerization-Through-NLP

## What Is Text Summarization?

Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document. Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and **natural language processing (NLP).**


## Why we need Text Summarization

In the big data era, there has been an explosion in the amount of text data from a variety of sources. This volume of text is an inestimable source of information and knowledge which needs to be effectively summarized to be useful. This increasing availability of documents has demanded exhaustive research in the NLP area for automatic text summarization. Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise and fluent summary without any human help while preserving the meaning of the original text document.


In general, there are two different approaches for automatic summarization: **extraction** and **abstraction.**

## Extractive Summarization

The name gives away what this approach does. **We identify the important sentences or phrases from the original text and extract only those from the text.** Those extracted sentences would be our summary. The below diagram illustrates extractive summarization:

## Abstractive Summarization

This is a very interesting approach. Here, we generate new sentences from the original text. This is in contrast to the extractive approach we saw earlier where we used only the sentences that were present. The sentences generated through abstractive summarization might not be present in the original text:
